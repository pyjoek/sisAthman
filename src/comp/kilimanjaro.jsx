                Mount Kilimanjaro, located in Tanzania, is the highest peak in Africa, standing at 
                approximately 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level. It is a free-standing 
                mountain rather than part of a mountain range, making it the tallest free-standing 
                mountain in the world. Kilimanjaro is composed of three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, 
                and Shira. Of these, Kibo is the highest and last to be active, with its last major 
                eruption occurring about 360,000 years ago.
